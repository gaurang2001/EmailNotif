# EmailNotif

This is an authenticated platform where admin can send
 message to registered users via email. Collect 
 relevant information from users so that admin can 
 notify user based on certain criteria(eg location).The 
 user data can be stored in a database of your choice. 
 Admin can either choose to notify everyone at once or 
 based on certain filters on user data. 
 
The admin is the user with the first record in DB. 

### Filters used 
- Location: Only a certain number of Locations can be selected by the user, 
hence making it simpler to send mail based on location.
- Gender: Male or Female
- Age/ age group: Send mails to all users belonging to a particular age or 
an age group.

## Email Protocol used
**SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**- 
 This is the standard protocol for sending emails 
 over the Internet. This is a protocol which is 
 used by a Mail Transfer Agent to deliver emails to a 
 recipientâ€™s email server. This is a protocol which 
 defines mail sending and cannot be used for mail receiving.
 Since this application is used to send mails and not receive any,
 I found it the most suitable to use. _*ActionMailer*_ of Ruby on Rails 
 handles the load of sending mails at the backend.
